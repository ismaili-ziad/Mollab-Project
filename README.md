# Mollab-Project
A software that computes input molecules' nomenclature.

Special thanks to: MAILLY Emeline (Physics and Chemistry teacher at Saint Paul High School in Lens, France)

The aim of the software is to compute the nomenclature of the input molecule automatically.
So far, OpenMollab doesnâ€™t have a user-friendly User Interface to design molecules. So, another alternative method is used and is described below. The molecules currently supported by OpenMollab are the following:

Functional group |	Group
| :---: | :---: |
Alkanes	| N/A
| :---: | :---: |
Alkenes |	Alkenes
| :---: | :---: |
Alcohol |	Hydroxyl
| :---: | :---: |
Aldehydes |	Carbonyl
| :---: | :---: |
Ketones |	Carbonyl
| :---: | :---: |
Amines | Amines
| :---: | :---: |
